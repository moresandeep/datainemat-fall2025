The Daytona on which it was based was never a true sports bike, being too heavy (especially top heavy) and unwieldy to compete with current sports bikes. The Super III was an attempt to shed weight and increase power, but combined with a very high price, only served to underline that this was a step too far for the original modular design. These have become collectible bikes.\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Daytona (T300)|Daytona 1200]]\\n|1180\\n|1992\\u20131999\\n|147&nbsp;bhp 4 cyl Sports Tourer. Though discontinued in '96, it was relaunched as a \\\"Special Edition\\\" in '98. Only 250 individually numbered machines were produced (the number being shown on a specially engraved plaque on the headstock). It featured with 6 pot brakes (from the Super III), black paint with gold lettering and gold wheels. One of the special plaques was damaged in production and, when another one was ordered, it came as \\\"number 251\\\" in error.\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Thunderbird 900|Thunderbird 900]]\\n|885\\n|1995\\u20132004\\n|\\nTriumph's first attempt to revive a classic-styled motorcycle based on its heritage, using the original modular platform.  Bike sported 18\\\" front tire and 16\\\" rear, detuned the 885 motor to 70&nbsp;hp with better lower-end torque.5-speed until engine number 71843, then all fitted with 6-speed.\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Adventurer 900|Adventurer 900]]\\n|885\\n|1996\\u20132000\\n|Thunderbird with wider 19\\\" front tyre, plus bob-tail rear fender similar to cruiser bike.

All 6-speed and 82&nbsp;bhp.\\n|-\\n|Daytona T595\\n|955\\n|1997\\u20131999\\n|The first true sports bike from the new Hinckley Triumph. Using an engine only very loosely based on the long stroke triple motor, it was much lighter, more powerful and used a unique alloy perimeter frame allowing the low centre of gravity and dedicated sports bike handling necessary to compete in this market. It also had an alloy single sided swing arm that was very similar to that offered by Ducati in their then current 916. The first production bikes featured a polished alloy frame, but these examples very quickly picked up a reputation for catastrophic weld failure on the top rail leading to the headstock. The frames were soon modified with a much larger weld on the top tube, though they were never supplied polished again, reverting to a silver/grey paint finish.\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Daytona 955i|Daytona 955i]]\\n|955\\n|1999\\u20132006\\n|The T595 was renamed 955 as it was too often thought to be a 600&nbsp;cc bike! It gradually evolved with a new bodywork and improved engine mapping. It lost the single sided swinging arm at one point, but then reverted to a single sided arm around a year later. Model eventually discontinued and never replaced as factory felt that the high level of investment necessary to stay competitive in the large sports bike market wasn't justified.\\n\\nAlso \\\"CE\\\" (Centennial Edition) version 2002\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Daytona 600|Daytona 600]]\\n|599\\n|2002\\u20132004\\n|\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Daytona 650|Daytona 650]]\\n|646\\n|2005\\u20132006\\n|Longer stroke version of Daytona 600\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Daytona 675|Daytona 675]]\\n|675\\n|2006-2016\\n|All new bike with all new three cylinder engine\\n|-\\n|Daytona 765\\n|765\\n|2020\\n|Limited production (1530 total), based on the Street Triple 765, plus tweaks from Triumph's Moto2 learnings.\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph TT600|TT 600]]\\n|599\\n|2000\\u20132002\\n|\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Bonneville Scrambler|Scrambler 900]]\\n|865\\n|2006\\u2013\\n|Street\\u2013scrambler styled trail bike, based on the 865&nbsp;cc Bonneville, 270\\u00b0 crank, high level exhaust system.

Using a counterbalanced air and oil cooled parallel twin motor, it looked as close to the original '60's version of the unit construction Bonneville as it was possible to within current noise and emission regulations. In 2002 Triumph released a limited edition model to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation. These collectable bikes were dubbed the \\\"Golden Jubilee\\\" and featured an exclusive paint scheme and badging.\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Bonneville Bobber|Bonneville Bobber]]\\n|1200\\n|2017-\\n| The Bonneville Bobber is a new Bonneville model introduced for the 2017 model year. It is a slightly modified version of the same 1200 cc engine introduced in the Bonneville T120 in 2016 which gives it a little less power but more torque.\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Bonneville T100|Bonneville T100]]\\n|790/865/900\\n|2002 on\\n|2002-2005 790&nbsp;cc, 2006 on 865&nbsp;cc, 2008 fuel injection replaced carbs, 2017 900&nbsp;cc Liquid cooled, 8 valve, SOHC, 270\\u00b0 parallel twin\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Bonneville T120|Bonneville T120]]\\n|1200\\n|2016-\\n| Brought back for 2016 an all new 1200&nbsp;cc Liquid cooled, 8 valve, SOHC, 270\\u00b0 parallel twin\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Speed Twin 1200]]\\n|1200\\n|2019-\\n|The '''Triumph Speed Twin 1200''' is a [[standard motorcycle]] made by [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd]] that is a modern successor of the original [[Triumph Speed Twin]] from 1938\\n|-\\n|Speed Triple 750\\n|748\\n|\\n|Budget Speed Triple using 750 Trident engine, only in production for a very short time.

Essentially a Daytona 900 without a fairing and fitted with a single round headlamp and conventional paired instrument pod. Originally (and pointlessly) sold with just a 5 speed gearbox, but later versions had the same 6 ratios as the 900 Daytona. Wildly successful and included its own racing series. Still top heavy and not a true sports bike, but one of the most charismatic bikes of the decade. Nearly always sold in all black, with orange being rare and yellow extremely rare.\\n|-\\n|Speed Triple T509\\n|885\\n|1997\\u20131999\\n|\\nReplacing the original 900 Speed Triple using, logically, the frame, motor (though originally in 885&nbsp;cc, rather than 955&nbsp;cc, guise) and much of the running gear from the new T595 sports bike. Again, there was no fairing, although this time it had twin headlamps in chrome pods to follow the \\\"Street fighter\\\" line, rather than the earlier \\\"cafe racer\\\" appearance. Much lighter and easier to handle than the earlier 900 Speed Triple it was equally successful, though the appearance of the new engine was probably better suited to being hidden behind a fairing.\\n|-\\n|Speed Triple 955i\\n|955\\n|1999\\u20132005\\n|\\n|-\\n|Speed Triple 1050\\n|1050\\n|2005-2020\\n|\\n|-\\n|Speed Triple 1200\\n|1160\\n|2021 on\\n|All-new design inspired by Moto2 and Street Triple 765\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Street Triple|Street Triple 675]]\\n|675\\n|2008-2016 \\n|Scaled down Speed Triple, based on Daytona 675 Chassis\\n|-\\n|Street Triple 765\\n|765\\n|2017 on\\n|\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Speed Four|Speed Four]]\\n|599\\n|2002-2005\\n|Stripped down TT600 with reworked engine\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Tiger 900 (T400)|Tiger 900]]\\n|885\\n|1993\\u20131998\\n|Dual sport with desert racer styling\\n|-\\n|Tiger 900i\\n|885\\n|1999\\u20132001\\n|Revamped model with fuel-injected motor based on T509 Speed Triple\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Tiger 955i|Tiger 955i]]\\n|955\\n|2001\\u20132006\\n|Increased displacement to 955cc, gradual changes made until end of production in 2006\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Tiger 1050|Tiger 1050]]\\n|1050\\n|2007 on\\n|\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Tiger 800|Tiger 800]]\\n|800\\n|2011 on\\n|All-new smaller Tiger with an engine based in part on the existing 675cc motor used in the Daytona 675 and Street Triple; was available in several road- and off-road-orientated versions\\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Tiger 900 (2020)|Tiger 900]]\\n|888\\n|2020 on\\n|Successor of the Tiger 800 \\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Thunderbird (2009)|Triumph Thunderbird]]\\n|1,600 and 1,700\\n|2009\\n|85 bhp(1600) 97 bhp (1700) bhp Parallel Twin, belt-drive cruiser \\n|-\\n|[[Triumph Trident 660]]\\n|660\\n|2020 on\\n|660cc 80 bhp tricylinder evolved from Street Triple 660.
